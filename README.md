ClickyGame Marvel Edition is a game app that render different superheroes images to the screen. Each image listen for click events.
The application keep track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will reset.

Technologies that I used: React, ES6, Bootstrap and CSS.
